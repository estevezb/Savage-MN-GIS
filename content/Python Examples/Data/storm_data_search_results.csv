The tornado struck a house which resulted in partial uplift of the roof and lofting of roofing materials. The tornado also flattened a decorative windmill and bent a flagpole. The roofing material was distributed downwind to a range of 380 yards. The tornado also snapped and uprooted several trees in this vicinity. The damage at this location was also rated EF-1. The sporadic damage track continued for another mile to the east-northeast. There was a distinct weakening of the tornado with several pockets of broken branches and limbs noted approximately 3 miles southwest of Zim. The tornado then turned southeast and the damage track tightened once again with a wide swath of EF-0 tree damage and pockets of low-end EF-1 damage. The sporadic EF-1 damage continued as the tornado crossed MN-7 and dissipated southwest of Stone Lake.","Tornadic thunderstorms formed in a very unstable airmass ahead of a cold front that moved through the area during the evening.

But these storms also produced a wide area of one half to two inches of rain by sunrise. ||The morning two events set the stage for flooding in central Minnesota as several additional waves of thunderstorms developed during the afternoon, and into the evening. By Tuesday morning, a wide area of three to six inches of rain fell from north of St. Cloud to Milaca and Mora. The highest totals were across northern Kanabec County where locally six to eight inches fell based on radar estimation. The Rum, Snake and Knife rivers spilled out of their banks and caused significant and widespread flooding. ||A secondary point related to this flooding event was that according to the Minnesota State Climatology Office, this storm, which continued into the morning hours of July 12th, was the largest mega-rain event since the Duluth flood of June 19-20, 2012. A mega-rain event is classified as a six-inch rainfall that covers at least a 1000 square miles, with a central core value of at least 8 inches. ||The secondary wave in the morning, weakened by the early afternoon. An isolated thunderstorms developed near Litchfield where an outflow boundary held from the previous morning storms.  These storms moved slowly northward and produced three tornadoes along this boundary. The first tornado occurred near Litchfield, the second near Watkins, and the third north of Watkins. ||The tornado near Litchfield was rated an EF-2 with peak winds of 115 mph. It had a maximum width of 100 yards and traveled approximately 3.1 miles. The tornado caused a lot of tree damage, though three single family homes received significant roof damage, and a double wide manufactured home, and garage were flipped and rolled. Another garage and shed were destroyed near Highway 12 on the north side of town.||The tornado near Watkins was also rated an EF-2 with peak winds of 125 mph. It had a maximum width of 400 yards and traveled approximately 2.1 miles. One injury occurred with this tornado. The first significant damage was to a business along Highway 55 on the south side of town. The tornado then tracked across the highway and passed through the St. Anthony Cemetery before passing through the center of Watkins doing damage to structures and many trees. The most significant damage occurred between Stearns Ave and Meeker Ave where several homes had significant roof damage, and had detached sheds, and garages destroyed. The tornado exited the town and did further tree damage at a farmstead outside of town before lifting shortly thereafter.||The tornado north of Watkins was rated an EF-1 with peak winds of 105 mph. It had a maximum width of 250 yards and traveled approximately 4.2 miles. This tornado was spawned by the same storm that moved through Watkins. Multiple chaser videos showed the Watkins tornado lifted off the ground as it became occluded, with this tornadoes touchdown point made visible by the presence of corn laid down in the field south of the first homestead hit. This was about two-thirds of mile north- northeast of where the Watkins tornado lifted. At the first farmstead hit, two open air cattle sheds where completely destroyed, along with a metal storage shed and two mostly empty grain bins. There were two cattle killed at this location as well. This storm destroyed more outbuildings at a farmstead along 160th street, with the rest of the damage along the path of the tornado being corn laid flat and tree damage.",33

The first damage observed was a camper/RV that was in a parking lot south of Highway 2 which was tossed across the highway into the parking lot of a furniture store building just north of the highway. The furniture store building had all of its south |facing windows blown out with damage to the front facade and some evidence of roof lift on the flat portion of the roof. The building also lost part of a gabled metal roof. A metal shed/outbuilding in the parking lot was completely destroyed. To the north, a two story building that includes a funeral home and post office had evidence of roof lift. Continuing north through the residential streets numerous trees were downed and several outbuildings - sheds and garage buildings - sustained significant damage, with some collapsing and others sliding off their foundations. This damage continued north- northwest, crossing state highway 6 around 7th Ave. Damage to the ball fields north of|town are believed to be part of the tornado���s path, with a small outbuilding and dugouts being destroyed and damage sustained to the metal chain link fence.

The majority of the damage was trees uprooted with several snapped along the way. Aerial imagery provided by the Pine County Sheriff���s Department shows fairly weak but convergent tree fall between I-35 and near Highway 61 and Owl Drive between a distinct intensification where the treefall becomes much more extensive and a metal roof section was lifted off a local business. The tornado then tracked across Highway 61 and traversed north causing mainly tree damage with at least one home losing some roof shingles.
