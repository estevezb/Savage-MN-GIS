Summary: Hello!

Hello! My name is Brian Estevez. I really enjoy using and learning about Python programming, UAV or Drone technology, and Geographical Information Systems (GIS).

This site is a place to share in the exploration of python programming itself, and its applications in GIS and UAV technology.

# **What is Python programming?**

Python is a popular computer programming language. Python programming is the practice of writing scripts or code that enable you to control, communicate with and connects to computers. Python programming is more than stringing code into apps; itâ€™s a way to explore the unknown, test ideas and solve real problems. Many fields (e.g., Atmospheric Sciences, Computer vision, and GIS) use python for software development, data analysis, and applications in artificial intelligence.
